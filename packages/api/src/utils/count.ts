/**
 * Determines if a direct count operation must be performed or the value can be obtained by using
 * pre-calculated values from aggregated stats tables, based on the provided filters.
 *
 * Aggregated stats are not available for certain filters, including:
 * - Reorged blocks (`blockType` filter)
 * - Specific `blockNumber` or `blockSlot` ranges
 * - Filters involving non-rollup addresses
 *
 * This function checks for those cases and returns `true` if a direct count is needed.
 *
 * @returns A boolean indicating if a direct count is required.
