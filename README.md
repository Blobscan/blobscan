Blobscan is the first blockchain explorer that helps to navigate and visualize those [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com) blobs, providing the necessary infrastructure to scale Ethereum.

The architecture of our system has the following parts:

- Modified consensus and execution layer clients
- A blockchain indexer that saves the data in a PostgreSQL database (we are migrating from MongoDB)
- A frontend that allows navigating the data, having specific pages for blocks, transactions, addresses, and blobs.

Blobscan was one of the [finalists](https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal/status/1579249265557192704) of the [ETHBogota hackathon](https://bogota.ethglobal.com/) in 2022,
and it is currently [funded](https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/02/14/layer-2-grants-roundup#-data-visualization) by the Ethereum Foundation.
