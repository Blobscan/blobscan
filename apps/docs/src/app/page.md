title: Welcome to Blobscan

Blobscan is a blockchain explorer for [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com) blobs.
This standard provides a new type of transaction that will help scaling Ethereum.

The architecture of Blobscan has the following components:

- An [indexer](/docs/indexer) that communicates with consensus and execution layer clients, fetches blob information and stores it in a PostgreSQL database
- A frontend that allows navigating the data, having specific pages for blocks, transactions, addresses, and blobs.
- An API that the indexer can talk to and contains shared logic with the frontend.
- A blob storage manager with support for different storage providers to keep blob data available.
- A blob propagator for propagating blob data across various storage systems through sandboxed workers.
- A couple of clis for managing blobscan stats and blob propagation jobs.
