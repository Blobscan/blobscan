---

## Requirements

- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Installing dependencies

Install a recent Node.js version and pnpm:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

Git clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Blobscan/blobscan.git
cd blobscan
```

Install all the Node.js dependencies:

```shell
pnpm fetch -r
pnpm install -r
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true npm run build
```

## Setup environment variables

{% callout type="warning" title="PostgreSQL database" %}
You need to have access to a database.
{% /callout %}

You can use the provided docker-compose file to spin up a PostgreSQL service:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d postgres redis
```

Configure the [environment variables](/docs/environment) accordingly, including the `DATABASE_URL`.

## Run

Then run the development command:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

Lastly, create the database schema:

```shell
pnpm db:generate
```

## Other commands

Metrics are recalculated every 15 minutes if you are running the cron job.

During development, you may want to force backfilling all the data, which can
be achieved using the following commands:

```shell
# Aggregates all blob data since the beginning
pnpm job:overall
```

```shell
# Aggregates all blob data for yesterday
pnpm job:daily
```

In case you need to delete aggregated metrics, you can use the stats aggregation cli:

```shell
cd clis/stats-aggregation-cli
pnpm start daily --delete
pnpm start overall --delete
```
