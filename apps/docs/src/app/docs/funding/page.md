Blobscan was honored to be one of the [top finalists](https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal/status/1579249265557192704) at the [ETHBogota hackathon](https://bogota.ethglobal.com/) in 2022. Since then, numerous organizations and projects have generously supported and funded our vision.

We deeply appreciate and extend our heartfelt gratitude to each one of them:
